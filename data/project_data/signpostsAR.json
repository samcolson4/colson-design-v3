    "intro1": "A small team built Signposts AR over the course of 10 days in order to develop our knowledge of Swift and Xcode.",
    "intro2": "Signposts is a discovery app for iOS devices. Users can place a sign in augmented reality (AR), to a specific place, perhaps indicating a great shop or point of interest. Other users can then view this sign on a map, or view it in AR if they are in the same location.",
    "screen1": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samcolson4/signposts-AR/main/screenshots/Register.png",
    "tech1": "Signposts AR is built with Swift, using UIKit, Storyboards, RealityKit, ARKit, Firebase and FirebaseAuth. We thoroughly tested the codebase using XCTest and ensured all features were fully tested both on simulator and on devices.",
    "tech2": "Signposts AR is currently in Beta on TestFlight.",

    "team1": "In order to ensure that we delivered the project in a tight timeframe, whilst also meeting our learning objectives, we ran daily stand-ups and retros. In the stand-up sessions, we allocated tasks based on which team member wanted to learn about a certain area, ensuring that everyone got ownership of the entire project.",
    "team2": "In our retros, we took time to reflect on what had gone well that day and what could be improved, ensuring that we actioned that as part of the next morningsâ€™ stand-up session. Each of these sessions was chaired by a member of the team on a rotating basis, meaning each member was able to experience leading the group.",
