    "team1": "In order to ensure that we delivered the project in a tight timeframe, whilst also meeting our learning objectives, we ran daily stand-ups and retros. In the stand-up sessions, we allocated tasks based on which team member wanted to learn about a certain area, ensuring that everyone got ownership of the entire project.",
    "team2": "In our retros, we took time to reflect on what had gone well that day and what could be improved, ensuring that we actioned that as part of the next morningsâ€™ stand-up session. Each of these sessions was chaired by a member of the team on a rotating basis, meaning each member was able to experience leading the group."
