          I recently completed a three month Makers Bootcamp where I taught
          myself Ruby, JavaScript and Swift by building a range of applications
          and websites. In my previous roles, I always pushed myself to learn
          more and to take ownership in as many areas as possible. I want to
          bring this attitude and my experience from Makers to my next role,
          building an outstanding product with clean, well-tested code, whilst
          continuing to develop my own engineering skills.

          During my time at Hilton, I worked across disparate teams to meet the
          company’s legislative objectives, aggregating expertise and knowledge
          to tackle complex challenges. I want to bring this experience to my
          next role and be a bridge between teams, looking at the big picture to
          ensure the whole company succeeds.
